          <p class="section__description">
            I’m a Multimedia Graphic Designer based in Colorado Springs, CO. I specialize in all things creative, fun, and colorful—and I’m always eager to learn something new! I like to think of myself as a <strong><em>“perfectionist who knows when to stop.”</em></strong> When you work with me, I’ll always strive to bring your vision to life as authentically as you imagine it, without wasting your time. I’ve always had a passion for creativity, especially when it comes to designing posters, stickers, branding, advertising, and other unique pieces.

        <p class="section__description">
         When it comes to design, what drives me is the impact good design can have on a community. Whether it’s helping a small business grow, shining a light on valuable local resources, or informing people about the options available to them, it all comes together to make lives better. I believe anything worthwhile is created in the best possible environment—that’s why I strive to make the design process fun, easy, collaborative, and thoughtful.

        <h2 class="section__header">How Did I Get Into Design?</h2>
        <p class="section__description">
         Ever since I was a kid, my mom and eldest sisters encouraged creativity. I’d sit for hours drawing, painting, doodling, making arts and crafts—just being creative with them—and I absolutely loved it! It felt like my calling, my safe space, and the thing I was most passionate about. I could get completely lost in it.

As I got older and started thinking about college and my future career, all I knew was that I wanted to be happy, and being creative made me happy. The only problem was, I didn’t know exactly what part of the creative industry I wanted to pursue. I never understood why I found things like advertisements, editing, layout, type, and fonts just as fascinating and creative as a painting. That curiosity stuck with me.

When it came time to apply for college, I knew I didn’t want to be a fine artist, I didn’t draw consistantly enough, and my interest in fine art was more about admiring others’ work rather than creating it. So, I scheduled an advising appointment to explore the creative class options. That’s when my advisor told me she thought I’d be a great fit for the Multimedia Graphic Design program at Pikes Peak State College.

Within the first two weeks of classes, I was hooked. I was having so much fun trying something new, even though it was a challenge at first, and from there, the rest is history!</p>
